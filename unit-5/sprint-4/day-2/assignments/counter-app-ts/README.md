## Description:-

- You have to build a Counter app with React+TS.
- All your code goes inside the `App.tsx` file.
- There you will have 4 buttons:-

  1.  Increment
  2.  Decrement
  3.  Increment5
  4.  Decrement5

- There will also be a h1 tag
- By default the text inside the h1 should be 0.
- When clicked the `Increment` button the counter should increase by 1.
- When clicked the `Decrement` button the counter should decrease by 1.
- When clicked the `Increment5` button the counter should increase by 5.
- When clicked the `Decrement5` button the counter should decrease by 5.

- Whenever the counter value changes change store the data in localStorage with key:- `counter`.

## General Instructions (**_IMPORTANT_**)

1. Do not use Global CSS, instead use `<componentName>.module.css` convention for Css in that file.

2. Do Not Remove ` data-testid="xxxx"` from anywhere, this are used by testing tools to test your code, removal of this will lead to low score.

3. Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders as chaging component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks.

4. Make sure you use only the given data and dont create new data, as chaging data might result in giving you zero marks.

**Note** - This might not be all the things, you are free to use other components. But make sure there is no error in your application(including TS Errors).

## General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug before itself
- we also request you not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
