Q1 --> what is the difference between Props and State?
Answer --> While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).


Q2 --> Explain the useState API?
Answer --> Basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.
The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . 

Q3 --> Explain the how map, filter, reduce work ?
Answer --> map → Executes a function on each element of an array. Every element of the array is passed to the callback function and returns a new array with the same length. 
filter → Remove items which don't satisfy a condition. 
Reduce → Creates a single value from elements of Array.

Q4 --> Create your own map, filter, reducer methods and attach it to an array using prototype chain .
