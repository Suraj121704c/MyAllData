## Features to build

1. The Application should have a `counter` with initial value set to `0`.

   - A `span` with `data-testid="counter` already exists in the boilerplate.

2. The Application should have three buttons

   - All three buttons are already in the boilerplate with the following `data-testid`
   - `plusonebtn`: This button should increment the count by one.
   - `minusonebtn`: This button should decrement the count by one. This button should be disabled if the count is equal to zero.
   - `resetbtn`: This button should reset te counter to zero.

3. The Application should display if the number is `odd-or-even`.

   - a span with `data-testid="odd-or-even"` is already present in the boilerplate. The span should display `Even` or `Odd` depending on the counter value.
   - These texts are case sensitive so be sure to cross check.

4. The Application should display if the number is `Prime` or Not.
   - a span with `data-testid="is-prime"` is already present in the boilerplate. The span should display `true` or `false` depending on the counter value.
   - **NOTE:** 0 and 1 are not Prime numbers.
   - These texts are case sensitive so be sure to cross check.

## General Instructions (**_IMPORTANT_**)

1. Do not use Global CSS, instead use `<componentName>.module.css` convention for Css in that file.
2. Do Not Remove `data-testid="xxxx"` or `data-cy="xxxx"` from anywhere, this are used by testing tools to test your code, removal of this will lead to low score.
3. Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders as changing component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks.

#### General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
