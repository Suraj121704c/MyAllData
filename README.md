- **Clone this repo on to your local system.**

    - **for example, if you are in unit-2 sprint-1 day-1 , go to `unit-2 → sprint-1 → day-1` and push your assignments**.
- **Your repo should be `private`, don’t change it to `public,`Masai team can access your repo even if it is private**.
- **For the entire masai journey, you should push all your assignments into this repo, you should not push to  seperate personal repo, untill and unless masai team asked to do so**.
- **Don’t share your repo link with any students, doing so will lead to termination**
