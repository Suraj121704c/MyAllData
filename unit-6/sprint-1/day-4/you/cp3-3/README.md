```

Create a Node.js program that allows for basic file manipulation.make functions which are taking arguments ad based on that manipulate `test.txt` file.

## Installation

- you can use any node version that works for you ( 14+ )
- please make sure you do not push package-lock.json

```
npm install

// complete functions on index.js

// test locally
npm run test
```

## Test Cases

- `** DO NOT USE ANY 3rd PARTY MODULE.`
- Create a file called "test.txt" in the same directory as your Node.js program.
  Export all the functions from index.js.

#### (a) isNumber function

- `Input:` takes a parameter "num".
- `Expected output:` if it is a number write `it is a Number.` else `it is Not a Number.` in the test.txt file.

#### (b) isStr function

- `Input:` takes a parameter "str".
- `Expected output:` if it is a string write `it is a String.` else `it is Not a String.` in the test.txt file.

#### (c) isArray function

- `Input:` takes a parameter "arr".
- `Expected output:` if it is a array write `it is a Array.` else `it is Not a Array.` in the test.txt file.

#### (d) isObj function

- `Input:` takes a parameter "obj".
- `Expected output:` if it is a Object write `this is a object.` else `this is not a object.` in the test.txt file.

#### (e) cls function

- `Expected output:` it should delete test.txt file if it is there.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of the mathematical operations
- Proper handling of command line arguments
- Proper implementation of random number generation
- Proper handling of edge cases
- Code readability and organization
- Comments explaining the logic behind each step

## General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
