    Masai Schools's Example (masai)

        2. instructors

        *student's collections ==> Document*
        student_code
        batch
        blood_group

        *instructor's collections ==> Document*
        emp_id
        sub
        expr

        *user's Collection ==> Document*
        user_id
        name
        email
        phone
        location
        gender
        blood_group

        ==> db.instructors.find({location:"BLR"})
        ==> db.ops.find({location:"BLR"})
        ==> db.sales.find({location:"BLR"})

        ==> db.users.find({location:"BLR"})
